# Orange Workflows for s-SNOM



In this repository there is some examples about how to open and post-process files from neaSNOM microscope.

The experimental data used in these examples was courtesy of FERES (2021).

In this equipament is possible to generate 3 main types of data, with a better descrition of this types in this respective folders.

 - [Point Spectrum](point-spectrum/README.md):

	This is just a spectrum measured in just on position.

	This data has a full spectrum data, wavenumber approximately 600 cm<sup>-1</sup> up to 2000 cm<sup>-1</sup>, but in only one pixel.

 - [Linescan](linescan/README.md):

 	In this case, a full spectrum of each pixel along a path choose is during the experiment.


 - [Hyperspectral Image](hyper/README.md):

 	In the last type is a full spectrum on each pixel inside an area.
